# Digital-Clock-and-Weather-App
Dabbling with jQuery and an API to create a Digital Clock/Weather app that changes appearance based on current time and weather.

Combined the Digital Clock and Night and Day projects found on https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/ as well as the Openweather API to create what you see.
